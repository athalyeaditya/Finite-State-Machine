Finite-State-Machine
====================

Simple Finite state machine implemented in Java which can be extended to suit needs of user.
This project will build a set of APIs which can be used within any project that wants to use Event driven statemachine.

A Finite statemachine has a start and end state and many other states in between. States have entry/exit actions. State machines also have transitions
which allow navigating between states. Events drive these transitions.
